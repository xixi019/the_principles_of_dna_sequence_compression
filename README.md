# The Principles of DNA Sequence Compression

Jupyter notebook to demonstrate the principles of DNA sequence compression.

Create a virtual environment, activate it, install required packages, and fire up jupyterlab:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter-lab
```

This should open the jupyterlab interface in your default browser. From here you can view, edit, and execute the notebook.
