# The Principles of DNA Sequence Compression

Jupyter notebook to demonstrate the principles of DNA sequence compression.

If you are on a Linux system ([WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) also counts), the most straightforward way is to do everything in a tidy and isolated virtual environment.

Create a virtual environment, activate it, install required packages, and fire up jupyterlab:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter-lab
```

This should open the jupyterlab interface in your default browser. From here you can view, edit, and execute the notebook.

In the case that you want or need to use an already existing jupyterlab installation, download the repository as a zip file, unpack it, and open the notebook using the interface from your existing jupyterlab installation.
